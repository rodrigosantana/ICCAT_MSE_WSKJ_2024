# Western Atlantic Skijack tuna Management Strategy Evaluation

## International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna - ICCAT

# 1. Background

The SCRS’s Tropical Tunas Species Group has been developing a management strategy evaluation (MSE)
framework for West Atlantic skipjack (W-SKJ) since 2020. In 2015, the Commission called for adoption of
a management procedure (MP) for W-SKJ and seven other priority stocks based on an MSE (Rec. 15-07).
This call for an MSE has been echoed in every ICCAT tropical tunas measure since 2016, with Rec. 16-01
setting initial performance indicators for tropical tunas. While the East Atlantic skipjack stock is included in
the multispecies MSE with bigeye and yellowfin tunas, western Atlantic skipjack has been earmarked for its
own MSE since the Commission’s first MSE roadmap was adopted in 2016; this is because western skipjack
tuna are caught predominantly in a single-species fishery.

External experts launched the MSE work in 2020 (SCRS/140/2020) and since then, MSE development has
been conducted by the SCRS (SCRS/2022/097, SCRS/2022/180, SCRS/2023/169). The Commission
adopted conceptual management objectives for W-SKJ in 2022 (Res. 22-02), and started to operationalize
those objectives at the May 2023 Panel 1 intersessional. The MSE work is on track for ICCAT to adopt an
MP in 2024, in accordance with the Commission’s MSE workplan.

Based on that, the general objective of this document is to provide minimal and sufficient knowledge to
facilitate discussion among scientists, fishery managers and other stakeholders involved, directly or
indirectly, on the development of W-SKJ MSE. Thus, as many of the techinical elements of the simulation
framework is now in an advance development or even complete, the SCRS is seeking guidance and feedback
from Panel 1 on some key elements that will be presented at section 5. Feedback Requested of this
document. In this sense, the next sections of this document will address and present a summary of the results
achieved so far in the W-SKJ MSE.

# 2. MSE Overview

The W-SKJ MSE is built using an open-source MSE software package called openMSE. The package can
input information from assessment models built with the Stock Synthesis framework (the 2022 W-SKJ stock
assessment, in this case) to efficiently create – and then customize – an MSE framework for testing
candidate management procedures (CMPs), including the approximately 100 CMPs that come preloaded in
openMSE.

## 2.1. Indices of Abundance

The western skipjack stock occurs from the U.S. coast to the southern Brazilian coast. Data from 5 different
indices (baitboat – Brazil recent and earlier period, Brazil handline, Venezuela purse seine, and U.S.
longline) are used to condition the MSE. On average, Brazil takes approximately 90% of the total skipjack
catch in the West Atlantic, with the bulk of remaining catches (7% on average) taken by Venezuela. The
MSE’s historical period is from 1952 through to 2020, and projections cover the subsequent 30 years.

## 2.2. Operating Models

Each operating model (OM) in the MSE represents a plausible scenario/a potential truth for the dynamics of
the stock and fishery. The W-SKJ MSE includes 9 main operating models (i.e., the “reference set or grid of
OMs”) based on two major sources of uncertainty:

1. Recruitment/steepness: a measure of the adult biomass relative to the number of young they
produce; reflects stock productivity (3 options);

2. Growth vector: reflects the alternative biological parameters of the population, including different
combinations of growth rate, maximum size, and natural mortality (3 options).

The 9 OMs allow for all combinations of these options (3x3=9). These 9 OMs were completely derived from
the last stock assessment of the W-SKJ conducted in 2022 (Report of the 2022 Skipjack Stock Assessment
Meeting). Thus, reflecting the same decision taking during the last stock assessment, the product of the all 9
OMs scenarios were also considered to be equally plausible, so they were equally weighted in this MSE.
This nine OMs together consisting in the reference operating models.

There are also two sets of “robustness” OMs already implemented. They were implemented to evaluate less
likely but still possible scenarios, similar to more extreme “sensitivity runs” in a stock assessment. These
additional scenarios included a new uncertainty axis containing two new levels. Both addressed possible
TAC implementation/control problems (e.g. 10% and 20% implementation error). This inclusion had
resulted in 18 new robustness OMs (9x2=18).

## 2.3. Management Objectives

The W-SKJ MSE currently includes twenty (20) key performance indicators as an initial benchmark for
evaluation of the Commission’s four agreed management objectives (see Appendix A). The limit reference
point (BLIM) is set at 40%*SSBMSY for western skipjack, as has been done for other stocks, including North
Atlantic swordfish, North Atlantic albacore and Atlantic bluefin tuna. The target reference point is set at
SSBMSY.

# 3. Work Plan for 2024

Below is described, in a hierarchical manner, the proposed work plan for the evolution and progress of the
W-SKJ MSE during 2024.

1) Presentation of current WSKJ MSE progress to the ICCAT committee during the 1 st Intersessional
Meeting of Panel 1 on Western Skipjack MSE [20-21 February];

2) Presentation of the demands and recommendations made by the ICCAT Commission during the 1 st
Intersessional Meeting of Panel 1 on Western Skipjack MSE to the SCRS group during the Yellowfin
Data Preparatory Meeting, including an action plan and methodological proposal for incorporating the
respective demands [8-12 April];

3) Update of the W-SKJ MSE process observing the action plan and methodology defined and discussed
during the Yellowfin Data Preparatory Meeting;

4) Presentation of the W-SKJ MSE evolution to the SCRS during the Yellowfin tuna Stock Assessment
Meeting, including the progress and evolution achieved up to the moment of this meeting, following a
previously approved action plan [8-12 July];

5) Implementation of new scenarios aiming to incorporate possible effects of climate change within the scope of the W-SKJ MSE;

6) Analysis of adherence and incorporation of abundance indices updated by the different CPCs and
previously presented at the Yellowfin tuna Stock Assessment Meeting into the performance metrics of
the candidates for management procedures defined to the W-SKJ MSE;

7) Presentation of W-SKJ MSE progress to the SCRS group during the SCRS Tropical Tunas Species
Group Meeting [16-21 September];

8) Incorporation of the proposals made by SCRS group during the last meeting of the SCRS Tropical
Tunas Species Group into the W-SKJ MSE process, as well as, the preparation of the communication
materials to be used at the 24th Special Meeting of the ICCAT Commission;

9) Support the presentation of W-SKJ MSE progress to the ICCAT Commission, Panel 1, during the
24th Special Meeting of the ICCAT Commission [11-18 November].
